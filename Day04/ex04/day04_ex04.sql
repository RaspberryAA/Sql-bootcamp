-- Write an SQL statement that satisfies the formula (R - S)âˆª(S - R) . 
-- Where R is the person_visits table with a filter on January 2, 2022, S is also the person_visits table
--  but with a different filter on January 6, 2022. 
-- Please do your calculations with sets under the person_id column and this column will be alone in a result. 
-- Please sort the result by the person_id column and present your final SQL in the v_symmetric_union (*) database view.
-- 
-- (*) To be honest, the definition of "symmetric union" doesn't exist in set theory. This is the author's interpretation, the main idea is based on the existing rule of symmetric difference.
