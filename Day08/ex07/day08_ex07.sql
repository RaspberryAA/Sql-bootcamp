-- Actually, we need two active sessions (i.e. 2 parallel sessions in the command line).

-- Letâ€™s reproduce a deadlock situation in our database.

-- Please write any SQL statement with any isolation level (you can use the default setting) on the table pizzeria to reproduce this deadlock situation.
